                                Cucumber. Cucumber's behavior-driven development (BDD) approach will be employed to
                                define
                                test scenarios and
                                steps in a human-readable format. A cucumber feature file will be created, specifying
                                the
                                expected behavior of the app.
                                Through the use of various cucumber options, such as features, glue, monochrome, dry
                                run,
                                snippets, and tags, the
                                testing process will be efficient and well-documented. The ultimate objective is to
                                ensure
                                that the Myntra app functions
                                correctly, providing a seamless and satisfying shopping experience to its users.</p1>
